Today, getting what you need is as easy as a trip to the store. From food to clothing, energy, medicine, and so much more, Andy George will discover what it takes to make everything from scratch. His mission is to understand the complex processes of manufacturing that is often taken for granted and do it all himself. Each week he‚Äôs traveling the world to bypass the modern supply chain in order to harvest raw materials straight from the source. Along the way, he‚Äôs answering the questions you never thought to ask.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1 - Tomine Harket]:
We're not in love
We share no stories
Just something in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind

[Chorus]:
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side

[Verse 2 - Au/Ra]:
Beneath the sky
As black as diamonds
We're running out of time
Don't wait for truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies

[Pre-chorus - Au/Ra]:
Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming

[Chorus]:
Take me through the night
Fall in to the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side

[Chorus]:
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side",Alan Walker,10,25134219,765897,12372,0,62045,DK,8/8/2018

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",The Late Late Show with James Corden,24,12332171,245192,4461,0,12665,DK,8/8/2018
