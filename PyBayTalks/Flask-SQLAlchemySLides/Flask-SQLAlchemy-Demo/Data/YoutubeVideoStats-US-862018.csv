Movie Musicals #44: JURASSIC PARK 3 THE MUSICAL
Alan Grant and Billy are tricked into visiting to Isla Sorna by Mr and Mrs Kirby where they meet a singing Spinosaurus, a T-Rex, a raptor family, pteranodons, and of course Cooper, a professional who can handle himself ...or so Udesky claimed.

‚ñ∫Script, Song, Vocals & Animation: Lhugueny
‚ñ∫Vocals and Co-Producer: WDi_40

---------------LYRICS---------------

Alan Grant:
Still digging up bones, sifting through the dirt,
Specialize in raptors, the way they hurt.
Ellie moved on for kids and a family,
I hate babies, they make me feel insanity.

Lecturing investors is bad enough,
I do it for the cash, but the crowd is rough.
""Would you return to Jurassic?"" That‚Äôs all they ever ask,
No force on earth or heaven could get me to go back.

Except money, obviously. Everybody needs money.

Raptor:
Smelly apes just breached our territory,
We need to go kill them all.
We‚Äôll wait and ambush, and then we‚Äôll rush, 
Snap their necks after they fall.

Spinosaurus:
Wanted to greet humans visiting,
They shot me, it‚Äôs so rude,
So I‚Äôll use them for food, 
I‚Äôm starving.

I will fight a T-Rex, wrestle him.
I star in this thriller,
Most effective killer, 
So I ask...

Chorus:
Am I hybrid, or natural?
Question that I ponder, cause I‚Äôm so much stronger, than the rest.
Am I hybrid, or natural?
Hunting down the humans, cause they hit my huge fin, with their plane.

Am I natural?
Or hybrid dino.
Am I natural?
Or hybrid dino.

Alan Grant:
Kirby lied about the nature of this mission,
Pop him in the nose for his dishonest decision.
Billy stole some eggs so I tell him that he‚Äôs scum,
Pteranodons turn him into prehistoric chum.

Escape in a boat, meet the Spino in the water,
He‚Äôs hungrier than hell and he‚Äôs ready for a slaughter.
Mr Kirby finds redemption, lures the beast away,
Then I shoot it with a flare and save the day.

Raptor:
Let‚Äôs work together to go end those humans,
They‚Äôre trying to run off with our eggs.
Maybe they‚Äôll fry em, and I would cry,
So we must bite em, so they die.

Spinosaurus:
Now that I have tasted human beings,
I can‚Äôt get enough cause,
Their meat isn‚Äôt tough,
It is so sweet.

Track em down before the raptors do,
Defeated a T-Rex,
Audience was upset,
By his death.

Paul Kirby:
This is your fault, and the guy you were banging,
Eric‚Äôs lost, Ben‚Äôs dead and hanging.
You need to stop yelling, can‚Äôt you see?
When the tricycloplots get ya, don‚Äôt come cryin‚Äô to me.

Pteranodon:
Sneak through the mist, you‚Äôll never hear me coming,
Use my giant wings to catch yo b***h a** running.
Let some of you escape, but you must pay the price,
Take Billy with my homies as a sacrifice.

Chorus
