Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",The Late Late Show with James Corden,24,11367099,230736,4174,0,12059,IS,8/4/2018

By FootballMinds

Liverpool 5-0 Napoli: Liverpool's penultimate pre-season friendly of the summer sees them take on Serie A giants Napoli in Dublin.

Following a week at their pre-season training camp in Evian, France, the Reds have headed to the Irish capital as they continue to tune up in preparation for their opening Premier League of the campaign at home to West Ham on August 12.

All eyes will be on Alisson at the Aviva, with the world's most expensive goalkeeper set to make his Reds debut , while the likes of Naby Keita, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri are also sure to feature.

Napoli won't be easy opponents though, as Carlo Ancelotti continues to stamp his authority on his new side after taking over from Maurizio Sarri this summer.",FootballMinds,17,951487,9386,390,0,1129,IS,8/4/2018

We've had a lot of ups and downs over the years, but today is, without question, the saddest day in the history of the Theorist community. We've lost a friend and team member, Ronnie ""Oni"" Edwards. For those who don't know, Ronnie has worked on this channel longer than anyone, hosting his own show as well as editing a HUGE number of the videos you've watched. In six years of working together, he contributed so much to what The Game Theorists is today. His loss is one that comes after years of him bravely working to move beyond the trauma of his past, fighting an internal battle every day, a battle that eventually became too much for him. This video is to honor his memory and remind everyone out there who also struggles with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts to reach out and keep talking because YOU ARE NOT ALONE...even when it feels like you are.

We'll miss you, Ronnie.

22,mLkHf7Z-gnw,This Pregnant Woman’s Dog Wouldn’t Stop Crying. Then She Realized It Was Trying To Warn Her,2018-07-23T19:15:00.000Z,UCMDGO5RoniTDI-iAo5KL5GQ,"When  Alhanna Butler was pregnant with her first child, her dog wouldn’t stop following her around and crying. At first, the mom-to-be found her pet’s attentiveness cute. However, she later discovered the animal was trying to warn her.

Alhanna and her husband Ricky come from Doncaster in England. The pair were childhood sweethearts, and after tying the knot the couple wanted to add to their family. So, first of all, they decided to get a dog.

However, they needed to decide which breed would best suit their family. After some research, they settled on getting an Akita, a smart breed that hails from Japan. The dogs are said to be quite protective of their owners. So, the Butlers knew it was the breed for them.
