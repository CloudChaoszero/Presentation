Movie Musicals #44: JURASSIC PARK 3 THE MUSICAL
Alan Grant and Billy are tricked into visiting to Isla Sorna by Mr and Mrs Kirby where they meet a singing Spinosaurus, a T-Rex, a raptor family, pteranodons, and of course Cooper, a professional who can handle himself ...or so Udesky claimed.

---------------LYRICS---------------

Alan Grant:
Still digging up bones, sifting through the dirt,
Specialize in raptors, the way they hurt.
Ellie moved on for kids and a family,
I hate babies, they make me feel insanity.

Lecturing investors is bad enough,
I do it for the cash, but the crowd is rough.
""Would you return to Jurassic?"" That’s all they ever ask,
No force on earth or heaven could get me to go back.

Except money, obviously. Everybody needs money.

Raptor:
Smelly apes just breached our territory,
We need to go kill them all.
We’ll wait and ambush, and then we’ll rush, 
Snap their necks after they fall.

Spinosaurus:
Wanted to greet humans visiting,
They shot me, it’s so rude,
So I’ll use them for food, 
I’m starving.

I will fight a T-Rex, wrestle him.
I star in this thriller,
Most effective killer, 
So I ask...

Chorus:
Am I hybrid, or natural?
Question that I ponder, cause I’m so much stronger, than the rest.
Am I hybrid, or natural?
Hunting down the humans, cause they hit my huge fin, with their plane.

Am I natural?
Or hybrid dino.
Am I natural?
Or hybrid dino.

Alan Grant:
Kirby lied about the nature of this mission,
Pop him in the nose for his dishonest decision.
Billy stole some eggs so I tell him that he’s scum,
Pteranodons turn him into prehistoric chum.

Escape in a boat, meet the Spino in the water,
He’s hungrier than hell and he’s ready for a slaughter.
Mr Kirby finds redemption, lures the beast away,
Then I shoot it with a flare and save the day.

Raptor:
Let’s work together to go end those humans,
They’re trying to run off with our eggs.
Maybe they’ll fry em, and I would cry,
So we must bite em, so they die.

Spinosaurus:
Now that I have tasted human beings,
I can’t get enough cause,
Their meat isn’t tough,
It is so sweet.

Track em down before the raptors do,
Defeated a T-Rex,
Audience was upset,
By his death.

Paul Kirby:
This is your fault, and the guy you were banging,
Eric’s lost, Ben’s dead and hanging.
You need to stop yelling, can’t you see?
When the tricycloplots get ya, don’t come cryin’ to me.

Pteranodon:
Sneak through the mist, you’ll never hear me coming,
Use my giant wings to catch yo b***h a** running.
Let some of you escape, but you must pay the price,
Take Billy with my homies as a sacrifice.

Chorus
