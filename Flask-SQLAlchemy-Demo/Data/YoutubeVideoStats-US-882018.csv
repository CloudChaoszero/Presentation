LYRICS
Oh I know how to levitate up off my feet,
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe,
And though I feed on things that fell,
You can learn to levitate with just a little help, 
Learn to levitate with just a little help.

Come down, come down,
Cowards only come through when the hour’s late,
And everyone’s asleep, mind you,
Now, show up, show up,
I know I shouldn’t say this,
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man.
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made,
I probably shouldn't show you but it’s way too late,
My heart is with you hiding but my mind's not made,
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say.
They’re smirking at blood, they're circling above,
But this is not enough,
Yeah this is not what you thought,
No, no we are not just graffiti on a passing train,
I got back what I once bought back,
In that slot I won't need to replace.
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today,
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain.
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through,
And sever all I knew. Yeah sever all,
I thought I could depend on, my weekends,
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on,
Please keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges,
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways,
Keep your wooden wedges under doors.
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse,
Now here comes the eight. Wait, habits here too,
You're the worst, your structure compensates,
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate,
By track two, at least they all know all they hear comes from a place.

Oh I know how to levitate up off my feet,
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe,
And though I feed on things that fell,
You can learn to levitate with just a little help, 
You can levitate with just a little help.

Explore neon culture through this local museum project: http://www.neonsigns.hk/?lang=en

Master Wu started making neon signs in the ’80s and has been filling Hong Kong’s streets with bright neon signs ever since. But recently, Master Wu has seen his business slow down as brighter-burning and more energy-efficient LED signs emerge. In addition to getting fewer requests, Hong Kong’s iconic neon landscape is also losing thousands of signs per year, ushering in the end of the city’s neon era. 

As Hong Kong’s neon lights start to fade, I spent some time with Master Wu at his neon shop, where he showed me how he makes neon signs, and took a look at Hong Kong’s changing cityscape.
