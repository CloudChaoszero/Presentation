Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",The Late Late Show with James Corden,24,11938659,239232,4333,0,12485,IS,8/6/2018

|| ABOUT ||
Today, getting what you need is as easy as a trip to the store. From food to clothing, energy, medicine, and so much more, Andy George will discover what it takes to make everything from scratch. His mission is to understand the complex processes of manufacturing that is often taken for granted and do it all himself. Each week he’s traveling the world to bypass the modern supply chain in order to harvest raw materials straight from the source. Along the way, he’s answering the questions you never thought to ask.

By FootballMinds

Liverpool 5-0 Napoli: Liverpool's penultimate pre-season friendly of the summer sees them take on Serie A giants Napoli in Dublin.

Following a week at their pre-season training camp in Evian, France, the Reds have headed to the Irish capital as they continue to tune up in preparation for their opening Premier League of the campaign at home to West Ham on August 12.

All eyes will be on Alisson at the Aviva, with the world's most expensive goalkeeper set to make his Reds debut , while the likes of Naby Keita, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri are also sure to feature.

Napoli won't be easy opponents though, as Carlo Ancelotti continues to stamp his authority on his new side after taking over from Maurizio Sarri this summer.",FootballMinds,17,2139215,14908,743,0,1624,IS,8/6/2018

We've had a lot of ups and downs over the years, but today is, without question, the saddest day in the history of the Theorist community. We've lost a friend and team member, Ronnie ""Oni"" Edwards. For those who don't know, Ronnie has worked on this channel longer than anyone, hosting his own show as well as editing a HUGE number of the videos you've watched. In six years of working together, he contributed so much to what The Game Theorists is today. His loss is one that comes after years of him bravely working to move beyond the trauma of his past, fighting an internal battle every day, a battle that eventually became too much for him. This video is to honor his memory and remind everyone out there who also struggles with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts to reach out and keep talking because YOU ARE NOT ALONE...even when it feels like you are.

We'll miss you, Ronnie.
